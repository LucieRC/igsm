The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Integrated Global System Model
========================================================================

This file contains some information on building the IGSM from source. For more
on the contents of the source tree, see the commit history at using 'git log',
or at http://svante.mit.edu/git/?p=igsm.git.

CONTENTS
--------

    atm -- atmosphere model
   chem -- atmospheric chemistry model
    clm -- "Community Land Model"
emiprep -- 'prep'rocessor for EPPA 5 'emi'ssions
    inc -- include files
   meta -- urban metamodel
 ocn_ml -- Two-dimensional, multi-layer (ml) ocean model
    ocm -- Ocean carbon model
    tem -- "Terrestrial Ecosystem Model"

DEPENDENCIES
------------
The following third-party packages are included in the code:

 clm/utils/esmf -- Earth System Modelling Framework (ESMF) [1]

BUILD
-----
The following process has only been tested on svante.mit.edu -- a Fedora Core
14 x86_64 system with GNU Make 3.82 [2], PGI 9.0.4 and NetCDF 3.6.2.

 1. Load the PGI [3] compilers and the NetCDF [4] libraries:

    $ module load pgi netcdf

 2. Create or edit the file inc/ctrparam.h. An example is provided at
    inc/ctrparam_igsm22_noclm.h.

 3. In the root directory, type:

    $ make

An executable named 'igsm22' is produced in the root directory. Currently there
is no automatic configuration script, and no build options (for target
directories, modules, features, etc.); the build can only be configured by
manually editing various include files.

EXECUTE
-------

### Preprocessing
The `emiprep` binary reads a file called `eppa5chm.put` from the current
directory and generates several files that are read by the IGSM. `eppa5chm.put`
can be obtained by copying the `chm.put` file produced by EPPA.

Only the EPPA 5 preprocessor is currently included. It is uncertain whether this
preprocessor also works for EPPA 4 output.

### Running

(To be added)
