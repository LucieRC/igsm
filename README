The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Integrated Global System Model
========================================================================

This file contains some information on building the IGSM from source. For more
on the contents of the source tree, see the commit history at using 'git log',
or at http://svante.mit.edu/git/?p=igsm.git.

CONTENTS
--------

 data -- Common data files (grids, etc.) for running the model
  src -- Source code for the modules of the model, includingâ€¦
          atm -- atmosphere model
         chem -- atmospheric chemistry model
          clm -- Community Land Model <http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/clm>
          inc -- INClude files common to all modules
         meta -- urban METAmodel
       ocn_ml -- two-dimensional, Multi-Layer (ML) OCeaN model
          ocm -- Ocean Carbon Model
          tem -- Terrestrial Ecosystem Model
 util -- Utilities including pre- and post-processing scripts
tests -- Example input files for common use cases

DEPENDENCIES
------------
The following third-party packages are included in the code:

 clm/utils/esmf -- Earth System Modelling Framework (ESMF) [1]

BUILD
-----
The following process has only been tested on svante.mit.edu -- a Fedora Core
14 x86_64 system with GNU Make 3.82 [2], PGI 9.0.4 and NetCDF 3.6.2.

(0) If building directly from version control: in the root directory, type:

    $ autoreconf

 1. Load the PGI [3] compilers and the NetCDF [4] libraries:

    $ module load pgi netcdf

 2. Create or edit the file inc/ctrparam.h. An example is provided at
    inc/ctrparam_igsm22_noclm.h.

 3. In the root directory, type:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

An executable named 'igsm22' is produced in the src/ directory. Some basic
documentation of options can be obtained by typing './configure --help', but
the build process is still mostly undocumented.

EXECUTE
-------

### Preprocessing
The `emiprep` binary reads a file called `eppa5chm.put` from the current
directory and generates several files that are read by the IGSM. `eppa5chm.put`
can be obtained by copying the `chm.put` file produced by EPPA.

Only the EPPA 5 preprocessor is currently included. It is uncertain whether this
preprocessor also works for EPPA 4 output.

### Running

(To be added)
