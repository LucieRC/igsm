BUILD
-----
  The following process has only been tested on svante.mit.edu -- a Fedora Core
14 x86_64 system with GNU Make 3.82 [5]; PGI 9.0.4 or 11.4; and NetCDF 3.6.2.

 1. If building directly from version control, in the root directory type:

    $ autoreconf --install

 2. Load the PGI [6] compilers and the NetCDF [7] libraries:

    $ module load pgi netcdf

 3. In the root directory, type:

    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make

  An executable named 'igsm22' is produced in ./build/src/. Some basic
documentation of options (for example, choosing between versions of CLM and TEM;
choosing historical or predictive models) can be obtained by typing
'../configure --help'; these should be given when invoking configure in step 3.

  Multiple builds can be maintained in this way, for example in directories
named 'build1', 'build2' (or something more informative). These directories may
even be outside the one containing this README file; this would require giving a
relative path when invoking configure (e.g. '../igsm/configure' or similar). To
see what options were passed to configure, see the file config.log in the build
directory.

  configure will abort if invoked in this (the top level) directory. This is to
keep built files separate from the IGSM source.


EXECUTE
-------

N.B.: Before running any of the experiments in the tests/ directory, copy the
entire directory out of the source tree into a separate location. This avoids
confusion when the experiments alter the files or create new ones, or updates
to the source also change the experiment input files.

### Preprocessing

  The `emiprep` binary reads a file called `eppa5chm.put` from the current
directory and generates several files that are read by the IGSM. `eppa5chm.put`
can be obtained by copying the `chm.put` file produced by EPPA.

  Only the EPPA 5 preprocessor is currently included. It is uncertain whether
this preprocessor also works for EPPA 4 output.

### Running

(To be added)
