Code copied from the following sources:

clm : /home/jscott/adam/CLM/4MIT2D/src
 - from /home/jscott/CLM_BUILD64_TEM:
  - mitbuild.jscott.csh (as prebuild.csh)
   - $INC_NETCDF, $LIB_NETCDF, $NETCDF environment variables are set by "module
     load netcdf"
   - $CSMDATA is set to a directory which doesn't exist. Must not be important?
  - Makefile.tem437 (as Makefile)
    - FFLAGS is set to include -c, which is wrong
  - Make_lib
