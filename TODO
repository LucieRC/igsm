To-Do List
==========

- Add to configure.ac until:
  - The user can choose which modules are compiled.
  - ctrparams.h is generated according to user options to 'configure', and with
    proper #defines to run the chosen set of modules.

- Move some subroutines (which?) from src/driver to src/atm.

- Add more verification experiments, including maybe:
  - atm-only
  - atm-clm
  - atm-clm-tem-gsolv
  - atm-clm-tem-chem (and eventually w/ 3D ocean)
  â€¦only the last is set up at present.

- Implement automatic testing to see if check-ins break code.

- Populate data/ with helper/non-run-specific data files, or provide a tarball
  at a standard location and a script to pull them down.

- Document what these files are, where they come from, what they contain, etc.

- Documentation of pretty much for everything else!

- Add 3D ocean to source control and the build system.
