To-Do List
==========

- Add to configure.ac until:
  - The user can choose which modules are compiled.
  - ctrparams.h is generated according to user options to 'configure', and with
    proper #defines to run the chosen set of modules.

- Allow the user to pick between different major releases, e.g. TEM 4.4b vs.
  4.3.7, or CLM 2.1 vs. 3.5. N.B. the build procedure for these two versions of
  CLM is very different.

- Implement VPATH for all modules so as to seamlessly allow user code
  modifications.

- Separate driver-related .F files from src/ocn_ml into a their own library.
  These files are shared with the 3D ocean. Some driver code could also be moved
  to the ATM module.

- Add more verification experiments, including maybe:
  - atm-only
  - atm-clm
  - atm-clm-tem-gsolv
  - atm-clm-tem-chem (and eventually w/ 3D ocean)
  â€¦only the last is set up at present.

- Implement automatic testing to see if check-ins break code.

- Populate data/ with helper/non-run-specific data files, or provide a tarball
  at a standard location and a script to pull them down.

- Document what these files are, where they come from, what they contain, etc.

- Documentation of pretty much for everything else!

- Add 3D ocean to source control and the build system.
